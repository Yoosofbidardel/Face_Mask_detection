# Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting impact in many countries worldwide since December 2020.Face Mask detection has turned up to be an astonishing problem in the domain of image processing and computer vision. Face detection has various use cases ranging from face recognition to capturing facial motions, where the lattercalls for the face to be revealed withvery high precision. Due to the rapid advancement in the domain ofmachine learning algorithms, the jeopardies of face mask detection technology seem to be well addressed yet. This technology is more relevant today because it is used to detect faces not only in static images and videos but also in real-time inspection and supervision.
# Description
Face Mask detection models have many variations. These can be divided into several categories like Boosting-based classification, Deformable Part Model-based classification and CNN base classification.
the algorithm that we use is CNN, which is one of the best efficient ones.

# Faded background

for better visual results we came up with the idea of fading background.
